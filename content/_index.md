During the day you can find working at [IMG Arena](https://imgarena.com) as a software engineer. I'm working on our cool suite of "event centres", live data widgets for sports with 3D visualisation and stats. At night, I'm mostly looking after my lovely 16 month old daughter and my wife, but I also like to tinker with my own projects.

You'll find on this websites random experiments, thoughts and ideas. I love me some good AI so that might be a topic. I'm also trying to learn japanese on the side and the potential for side projects is endless there. Occasionally I might bore you with more philosophical questions, so be warned.
