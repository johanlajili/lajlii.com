Every blogpost must start with a single post. This is the one.

Let me take this opportunity to mention the tech stack behind this website.

<!-- more -->

This is a static site generated with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). I'm using a theme called [DeepThought](https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/DeepThought).

**Zola** is a static site generator, written in rust. It's a pretty neat tool, following one of my favourite programming mantra, "keep it simple stupid". Took me half an hour to go from "hey, I should resurect [lajili.com](https://lajili.com)" to "git push" to send it to prod.

Finally, the avatar on the main page was generated with midjourney, and my daughter absolutely loves it.
